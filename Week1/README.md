# Postgrad Practice Week 1

## Agenda

1. JavaScript Cardio I
2. Algorithms I
3. Application Development I
4. Technical Assignment I

### 1. JavaScript Cardio I

In order to become good at using a programming language, it's important to know the syntax. The various versions. And the different ways these can be used to write useful programs.

In this section you'll get several exercises you can do to train your ability to use the language of JavaScript:

- [JavaScript Array Cardio Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs)
- [.some(), .every(), .find() and [...SPREADS] â€” Array Cardio Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmRfyNg1lw)

### 2. Algorithms I

Thinking algorithmically is an essential part of a developer's mental toolkit. But what is an algorithm?

> An algorithm is a specific set of steps that can be used to solve a (coding) problem.

From this we can infer that `thinking algorithmically` refers to the ability of thinking in steps. Applied to programming, it means:

- Splitting a problem up into smaller problems to solve easily.
- Translating the steps into code

You might think, "easier said than done!", and you are right. That's why we practice.

In the following links you'll find several exercises to practice your algorithmic thinking skills! Do at least 5 of them.

### 3. Application Development I

As a starting developer it's very important to have a tight grip on the fundamentals. That's why you're going to build (another) full-stack application from scratch.

Choose any one of the following courses and stick to it for the next 4 weeks:

- [Build a Placesharer Application](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/)
- [Build an Ecommerce Application](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-the-complete-guide/)
- [Build a Social Networking Application](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/)

After you chose your pick, here's what you're going to do:

1. **Make a plan**. Divide the course into 4 blocks. Make sure there's enough content for each week.
2. **Code along and play around**.
3. **Reflect on what you learn**.
4. **Discuss with others what you've learned**

When starting the course, create a GitHub repository and start tracking it. You want to get as much practice using GIT and GitHub in as possible, because that's exactly what you'll be doing in real life.

Finally, try and finish the first quarter of the course by the end of the week. Hold yourself accountable for your progress!

### 4. Technical Assignment I

When applying for jobs a company most likely will give you a technical assignment to do. Why? They want to test your skills.

In this bi-weekly assignment, you're asked to pick a technical assignment from [this list](./../technical-assignments/README.md) and work on it for two weeks.

Doing this will help you become familiar with the process and give you a sense of what companies are expecting you to be able to do.

Work on this assignment for two weeks. **Deadline is next week Saturday 23.59 CET.**

One tip before you start: imagine doing this for a real company. Because that's the only way you'll train yourself to take it seriously. (And maybe it will even lead to opportunities...)

### Finished?

At the end of this week you need to deliver upon the following:

1. A video explaining 1 concept you've learned about most about during the development of the project you're working on. Post the video in the Slack channel

Here are the requirements you have to fulfill:

- A general high level explanation of the concept: how + why
- A self-written code example that you analyse and explain step-by-step
- The video should include both your screen and your webcam view (we want to see your face!)
- It should be around 5 minutes

2. Write out in 100 words or less your number #1 key lesson you learned this week. Post the message in the message in the Slack channel

> Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access".
