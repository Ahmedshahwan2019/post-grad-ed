# Post Graduation Education

![Postgrad](postgrad.png)

Dear alumnus, congratulations on finishing the HackYourFuture 7 month program!

In this repository youâ€™ll find outlined a post graduation education curriculum. It's **optional** and serves as a structure for you to use whenever you want to prepare yourself for a job.

There are a couple of things we can work on:

(TECHNICAL)

- Web Application development
- Algorithmic thinking
- Technical assignments

(COMMUNICATION)

- Explaining technical concepts
- English fluency
- Confidence & mindset

Each week you'll do exercises in order to strengthen all these skills. You'll also practice solidifying the fundamentals of web development:

- JavaScript fundamentals (basic syntax, event loop, OOP)
- Validation
- Authentication & authorization
- Client-server model
- The role of JSON (parse, stringify)
- Server-side/client-side routing
- Database modeling
- Frontend state management
- Code modularization
- Working with external services/APIs

Use this list as a checklist. Ideally, in 4 weeks you should be very clear about what each of these concept mean and what their role is in application development.

## Accountability

In order to stay motivated it's good to hold yourself accountable. That's not always that easy. Therefore, HackYourFuture has created a special channel on Slack that you can use in order to discuss, ask for help and keep your motivation.

## Planning

| Week | Topic                                                                                       | Homework                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1.   | JavaScript Cardio I, Algorithms I, Application Development I, Technical Assignment I        | [Practice W1](/Week1/README.md) |
| 2.   | JavaScript Cardio II, Algorithms II, Application Development II,                            | [Practice W2](/Week2/README.md) |
| 3.   | JavaScript Cardio III, Algorithms III, Application Development III, Technical Assignment II | [Practice W3](/Week3/README.md) |
| 4.   | JavaScript Cardio IV, Algorithms IV, Application Development IV,                            | [Practice W4](/Week4/README.md) |

## Goal

The goal of this curriculum is NOT to go through it and finish "knowing" how to do all these things. Working on these things is a never-ending process.

Instead, your goal should be to become familiar with these topics and always keep on learning.
