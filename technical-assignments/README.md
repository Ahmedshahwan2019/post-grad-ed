## The why of TAs

Technical assignments aren't made to torture you (even though it might feel that way). Instead, they are made for 2 main reasons:

- It gives the company an understanding of your skill set

All a company wants is to **find the right people, for the right job**. As a software developer they'd like you to write good software. Of course, you don't have to write a complete application to show them what you can do. They neither have the time nor the money to go through it.
