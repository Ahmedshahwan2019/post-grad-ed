# Postgrad Practice Week 3

## Agenda

1. JavaScript Cardio III
2. Algorithms III
3. Application Development III
4. Technical Assignment II

### 1. JavaScript Cardio

It's time for some more Cardio! Follow the instructor and code along. A useful tip while learning is this: don't just brainlessly follow along. Instead, question what he's doing: why this way and not that way?

### 2. Algorithms III

It's time for some more advanced algorithm challenges. These build on your skills gained from the previous week.

If it seems daunting, don't worry! You don't need to be a genius to solve them.

Here's the secret behind algorithm challenges: **they're actually solutions to common programming problems**. If you can learn, memorize and understand them, you'll become a great developer in no time!

### 3. Application Development III

You're now 50% in! You're doing great! Let's continue this week with the third part of the course.

While you're doing it, I'd like you to reflect on the list of concepts shared with you at the beginning of the week:

- JavaScript fundamentals (basic syntax, event loop, OOP)
- Validation
- Authentication & authorization
- Client-server model
- The role of JSON (parse, stringify)
- Server-side/client-side routing
- Database modeling
- Frontend state management
- Code modularization
- Working with external services/APIs

Are you able to understand them better now? If asked, would you be able to explain each concept and also how it applies to your project?

### 4. Technical Assignment II

It's time for another technical assignment! If you've been doing the other one, you might've noticed how different it feels. The fact that
