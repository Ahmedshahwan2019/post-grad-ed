# Postgrad Practice Week 2

## Agenda

1. JavaScript Cardio II
2. Algorithms II
3. Application Development II

### 1. JavaScript Cardio

We'll continue with more JavaScript Cardio. You'll be doing several algorithm challenges. Code along with the instructor and play around with the solutions.

### 2. Algorithms II

Let's continue with more algorithm challenges. Like last week, try to solve at least 5 of them.

Do research, try to think step-by-step. And always remember that there are multiple solutions to the same problem.

### 3. Application Development II

Continue with the second part of your chosen course. Have you gained any new insights so far? Write them down! You want to keep track of these, as it will help you retain what you're learning.

To help you during the process, here are a list of questions you can keep in mind to accelerate learning:

- Why is this (not) working?
- How does this concept relate to that concept?
- Am I able to articulate what's happening?
- How is this application different/similar to my previous project?

### Finished?

Keep yourself accountable! Post a message to the Slack channel mentioning your progress, and your number #1 key learning this week.
